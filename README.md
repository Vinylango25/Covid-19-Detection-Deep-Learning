Machine learning (ML) and deep learning have emerged as pivotal technologies in the fight against COVID-19, significantly enhancing detection and diagnosis capabilities. ML algorithms, including support vector machines and random forests, have been employed to analyze complex datasets, such as medical imaging and patient symptoms, to identify patterns indicative of the virus. Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has excelled in processing and interpreting chest X-rays and CT scans, providing rapid and accurate diagnosis by highlighting features consistent with COVID-19 infection. 

These advanced models can achieve higher accuracy rates and faster processing times compared to traditional methods, crucial for managing high patient volumes and mitigating the spread of the virus. Furthermore, ML and deep learning have been instrumental in predicting outbreaks and monitoring the disease's progression. By integrating diverse data sources—such as social media trends, mobility data, and epidemiological reports—these technologies can forecast potential hotspots and trends, enabling proactive responses and resource allocation. Predictive models powered by deep learning techniques also support vaccine development and treatment strategies by simulating virus behavior and drug interactions. Overall, the application of ML and deep learning has transformed COVID-19 detection and management, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize healthcare in the face of global pandemics.

I have used the available SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset, containing 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) 
and 1230 CT scans for patients non-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total to test a number of CNN architectures in predicting
whether a patient is covid positive or negative. These data , which is available publicly were  collected on real patients in 
hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The dataset can be accessed through the link below.

All the CNN architecture tested which includes; CustomCNN, MoblileNetV2, DenseNet169 and ResNet50,achieved an accuracy of over 93% on the test set. Furthermore, 
an ensemble  of all the models achieved an accuracy of 99%.
