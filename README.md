I have used the available SARS-CoV-2 CT scan dataset, containing 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) 
and 1230 CT scans for patients non-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total to test a number of CNN architectures in predicting
whether a patient is covid positive or negative. These data , which is available publicly were  collected on real patients in 
hospitals from Sao Paulo, Brazil. The dataset can be accessed through the link below.

All the CNN architecture testedwhich includes; CustomCNN, MoblileNetV1, DenseNet169 and ResNet50,achieved an accuracy of over 93% on the test set. Furthermore, 
an ensemble  of all the models achieved an accuracy of 99%.
